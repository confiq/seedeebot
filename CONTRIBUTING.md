# Slackbot developer guide

Thanks for your interest in developing Slackbot! These notes should help you produce pull requests that will get merged without any issues.

## Style guide

### Code style

There are places in the code that do not follow PEP 8 conventions. Do follow PEP 8 with new code!

### Commits

It's a good idea to use one branch per pull request. This will allow you to work on multiple changes at once.

Most pull requests should contain only a single commit. If you have to make corrections to a pull request, rebase and squash your branch, then do a forced push. Clean up the commit message so it's clear and as concise as needed.
